# 🦴 AI-Powered X-Ray Fracture Detection

This project is a deep learning-based medical imaging tool designed to identify wrist fractures in X-ray images using a YOLOv8 classification model. Built for deployment on the Jetson Orin Nano, it enables fast, on-device analysis of medical scans with automatic triage logic based on confidence levels — helping reduce wait times and assist clinical decision-making.

## 🔍 Features

- 📸 Classifies X-ray images as **fractured** or **normal**
- ⚙️ Built using **YOLOv8** and the **Ultralytics** API
- 🧠 Confidence-based triage logic to recommend action
- 🐧 Designed to run on Jetson Linux devices (e.g. Orin Nano)
- 📂 Scans any image placed in a target folder or selected individually
- 📝 Clear terminal outputs for file name, prediction, confidence, and decision

## 🚀 Example Output

---------------------------------------------------
📸 Image Path:     /home/nvidia07/X-RAI/toscan/example.jpg
🧠 Prediction:     fractured
📈 Confidence:     88.30%
✅ Decision:       Fracture detected with high confidence.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Pillow (PIL)
- Jetson Orin Nano (recommended, but not required)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/x-ray-fracture-detector.git
   cd x-ray-fracture-detector

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install ultralytics pillow

> On Jetson, make sure your CUDA drivers and environment are correctly set up.

## 🧪 How to Use

🔹 Classify a Single Image

1. Place your image inside the `toscan/` folder.
2. Open `main.py` and update this line:

   IMAGE_FILENAME = "your_image_name.jpg"

3. Run the script:

   python3 main.py

## 🔣 Sample Script

from ultralytics import YOLO
from PIL import Image
import os

MODEL_PATH = "/home/nvidia07/X-RAI/runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt"
TOSCAN_DIR = "/home/nvidia07/X-RAI/toscan"
IMAGE_FILENAME = "INPUT_IMAGE_HERE.jpg"
IMAGE_PATH = os.path.join(TOSCAN_DIR, IMAGE_FILENAME)

model = YOLO(MODEL_PATH)
results = model.predict(source=IMAGE_PATH, save=False)

probs = results[0].probs
class_names = model.names
pred_index = probs.top1
pred_label = class_names[pred_index]
confidence = probs.data[pred_index].item() * 100

def make_decision(label, conf):
    if "fracture" in label.lower():
        if conf >= 70:
            return "Fracture detected with high confidence."
        elif 50 <= conf < 70:
            return "Possible fracture detected – refer to doctor."
        else:
            return "Possible fracture, but AI is unsure – refer to doctor."
    else:
        if conf >= 70:
            return "No fracture detected with high confidence."
        else:
            return "No fracture detected, but AI is unsure – refer to doctor."

print("---------------------------------------------------")
print(f"📸 Image Path:     {IMAGE_PATH}")
print(f"🧠 Prediction:     {pred_label}")
print(f"📈 Confidence:     {confidence:.2f}%")
print(f"✅ Decision:       {make_decision(pred_label, confidence)}")
print("---------------------------------------------------")
